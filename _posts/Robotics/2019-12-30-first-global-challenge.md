## Overview
So we had the honour of representing Team Singapore in the FIRST Global Challenge 2019. This year's challenge was to essentially deposit balls into a high goal, roughly 3-4 times the height of the robot. We decided to build a flywheel.

## Implementation
I was simply a secondary school freshman when our club last did a flywheel during the VEX Robotics 2015-2016 Season (Nothing But Net). In other words, I had no knowledge on PID. If you do not know what PID is, I suggest you read my [introduction to PID](https://jloh02.github.io/robotics/introduction-to-pid/) first.
