							Throughout my years of STEM education through the Robotics CCA and computer science curriculum, I've had the opportunity to learn a lot about different aspects of STEM including robotics, cybersecurity, machine learning, electronics and competitive programming.
						</p>
						<p>
							I first started learning electronics, including soldering and wire management when I participated in RoboCup in 2016. I was entirely unfamiliar with electronics as a whole as the only "electronics" I was exposed to at that time was plugging in sensors into robots. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Out of personal interest, I started machine learning in 2019 with Kaggle competitions. This would later prove to be useful in my IB Computer Science Extended Essay as well as the 2020 Cyberthon CTF.
						</p>
						<p>
							Such projects allowed me to further my interest in STEM and gave me a wider variety of knowledge.
						</p>
