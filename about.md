## Introduction

  <p>
I am Jloh, a Singaporean who started my interest in STEM eduction in 4th Grade when I joined my school robotics club. I have been participating in robotics competitions under the club <a href="https://www.instagram.com/8059blank/">8059 Blank.</a> since I was in 7th Grade. I also gained interests in playing CTFs since 2018. I play under <a href="https://hats.sg">HATS SG</a> (though I'm pretty much useless there), acsii and ItzyBitzySpider.
